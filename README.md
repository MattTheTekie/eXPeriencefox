# eXPeriencefox
A Internet Explorer 6 theme for Firefox, designed for the Windows eXPerience mod.

## Installation
Installation of the latest theme is required, as Firefox commonly breaks custom themes by every update. As Windows eXPerience uses a outdated version of Firefox (Firefox 109), Firefox will update to the latest, which will result to a broken theme.
